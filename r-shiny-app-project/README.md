BF591 Final Project: R-Shiny Application

The aim of this project was to create an R Shiny application to run and visualize the results of bioinformatic analyses on a dataset. The input dataset was downloaded from Labadorf et al.'s [RNA Sequence Analysis of Human Huntington Disease Brain Reveals an Extensive Increase in Inflammatory and Developmental Gene Expression](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0143563). The application features four tabs that explore the sample information and normalized count matrix, as well as run a differential expression analysis and a gene set enrichment analysis.
