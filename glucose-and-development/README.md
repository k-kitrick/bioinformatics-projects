BF550: Project 2

The aim of this project was to reproduce 2 figures from a paper using data analysis and visualization in Python. The paper chosen was Thompson et al.'s [Effect of High Glucose on Embryological Development of Zebrafish, Brachyodanio, Rerio through Wnt Pathway](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25179443).
The uploaded jupyter notebook contains the analysis and figures, while the associated data folder contains the downloaded gene count file and corresponding metadata.
